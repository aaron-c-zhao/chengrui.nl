            <p>My name is Chengrui Zhao. I'm a backend developer based in the Netherlands. I started my career as a developer in my 30s. 
                After almost 10 years being an investment manager in a state owened company in China. So far I can say this is the best decision that I have ever made.</p>

            <p>Professionally, I'm working at <code>Adyen </code>as a Java backend developer at the moment. In forseeable future, I would say backend development will be my focus, although
                I'm interested in all sorts of technologies. As a hoby, I run my own homelab, so I'm pretty into <code>linux system administration</code>, <code>networking</code>, <code>cloud technologies</code>. 
                And recently, out of curiosity, I learned a little bit <code>CSS</code>, which gave me the motivation to build this site as a practice project. Also, It would be nice to 
                have a knowledge base that can be shared unlike my <code>logseq</code>.</p>

            <p>I don't have a strict plan of what I'm going to share here. Probably it's gonna be a little bit of everything that I have interest in. Could be developing related, gaming,
                tech gadgets, or even some lesson learned during my process of moving to a new country.</p>

            <p>If you want to get in touch, you can find me on Linkedin.</p>
