            <p>My name is Chengrui Zhao. I'm a backend developer based in the Netherlands. I started my career as a developer in my 30s. 
                After almost 10 years working in a state owened company in China as investment manager. So far I can say this is the best
                decision that I have made.</p>
            <p>I'm working at Adyen at the moment with Java as primary language. Though my career focus will probably stay in backend 
                development for the foreseeable future, I'm interested in all sorts of technologies.</p>
                
            <p></p>I run my own homelab, so I'm pretty into linux system administration, networking, cloud technologies. And recently, out of curiosity, I learned a little bit CSS, which
                gave me the motivation to build this site as a practice project. Additionally, it would be nice to have a knowledge base that can be shared besides my logseq database.
